## To-do:

- Removing a character from Registered characters should remove it from Verified characters
- Allow for removing a character verification
- html content is able to overflow in the x direction
- Should hide the "See Also" content for Page 2 of Registration and Pages 2-3 of Verification
- Content layout shift should be reduced by using placeholders
- Nav menu links go to fake pages
- On mobile:
-   - There's no visual indication that a character has been registered
-   - The Registration page table overflows
-   - text-align: justified doesn't look great for small paragraphs
-   - <ul> lists should have less margin-left
